ðŸ“Œ What we can do with DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

DSA is the backbone of programming and problem-solving. It helps you to:

Store and organize data (Data Structures part).

Example: Store student marks in an array.

Example: Maintain a waiting line (queue) at a bank.

Example: Maintain browsing history (stack).

Perform operations efficiently (Algorithms part).

Searching: Find a name in a phonebook.

Sorting: Arrange marks in ascending order.

Pathfinding: Find the shortest route on Google Maps.

Solve real-world problems faster.

If you use wrong logic â†’ program may work but be slow.

With the right DSA â†’ program is fast and optimized (important for coding interviews & real projects).

ðŸ”¹ Simple Example 1 (Array + Algorithm)

Problem: Find the largest number in an array.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 45, 67, 32, 89, 23};
    int n = 6;
    int max = arr[0];

    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] > max) {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }

    printf("Largest number = %d\n", max);
    return 0;
}


âœ… Data Structure used: Array
âœ… Algorithm used: Linear Search for maximum
